\begin{abstract}
    We present an introduction to and analysis of Elementary Cellular
    Automata (ECAs) as defined in Stephen Wolfram's
    \emph{A New Kind of Science}.
    ECAs are inherently nonlinear and their time evolution can
    exhibit extremely complex behavior, which is surprising (better
    % TODO
    word!) given the simple rules which govern their dynamics.
    This report demonstrates a simple analysis of a few of the more
    interesting ECAs in the context of nonlinear systems.
