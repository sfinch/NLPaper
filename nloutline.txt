Elementary Cellular Automata

1. Intro
 - What is a ECA
 - Rules and rule numbering
 - Examples (many figures)

2. Simple Analysis
 - Define observable: density of black blocks
 - Show plot of density as function of time
 - FFT and Autocorrelation of density for different rules
 - Periodic Boundary Conditions

3. ECA as Discrete Maps
 - PBC
 - Finite width (FBC?)
 - How to define the maps
 - Figures of mapping functions
 - Show some cycles
 - Period of limit cycle

4. Conclusion
