\section{Simple Analysis}

% TODO BETTER TITLE

An Elementary Cellular Automaton with $n$ sites per time step has
$n$ degrees of freedom.
As one studies ECAs with larger $n$ values, it becomes a daunting
task to track the state of each site at each time step, and an
analysis of the time evolution of the system as a whole becomes more
meaningful.
In order to study the general behavior of the ECA systems, we wanted
to define an observable which collapsed these $n$ degrees of freedom
into one number whose value could be traced through many time steps.
However, there are only so many such observables for such simple
systems.
One ought to choose an observable whose value is meaningful for a wide
variety of initial conditions and boundary condition constraints.


\subsection{Defining an Observable}

We chose to study on the density of black blocks as a convenient
method for collapsing the information encoded in an $n$-site ECA into
one value per time step.
For ECAs with periodic or fixed boundary conditions, the density of
black blocks is straightforward:

\begin{equation}
    \rho = \frac{n_{black}}{n},
\end{equation}

\noindent where $n$ is the number of sites in the ECA.

One must be careful in the case of ECAs without boundary conditions
because the extent of the ECA is essentially infinite, and the above
definition of the black block density is not well-defined.
However, because the ECA rules only allow the state of a block to
depend on the previous states of its immediate neighbors, by choosing
an initial condition of one black block there can be no black blocks
outside of the triangle defined by $2t+1$, where $t$ is the number of
time steps since the initial state.
Treating $2t+1$ as the effective size of the Cellular Automaton, the
density can then be redefined as

\begin{equation}
    \rho = \frac{n_{black}}{(2t+1)}.
\end{equation}


\subsection{Density Time Evolution}
% TODO MAXIMUM
For ECAs with periodic or fixed boundary conditions, there is a
maximum number of states available to the system: if there are $n$
sites and each must have a value of 0 or 1, there will be $2^n$
states.
As such, after a maximum of $2^n$ time steps the system must return to
a state that it has visited previously.

However, ECAs with no boundaries have access to an infinite number of
states.
